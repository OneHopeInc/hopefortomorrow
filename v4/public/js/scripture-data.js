About the time his money ran out, a great famine swept over the land, and he began to starve. He persuaded a local farmer to hire him, and the man sent him into his fields to feed the pigs. The young man became so hungry that even the pods he was feeding the pigs looked good to him. But no one gave him anything."</span>',

I will go home to my father and say, \"Father, I have sinned against both heaven and you, and I am no longer worthy of being called your son. Please take me on as a hired servant.\"\'"</span>',
			'<span class="jesus-speaks">"So he returned home to his father. And while he was still a long way off, his father saw him coming.

			'<span class="jesus-speaks">"But his father said to the servants, \'Quick! Bring the finest robe in the house and put it on him. Get a ring for his finger and sandals for his feet. And kill the calf we have been fattening. We must celebrate with a feast, for this son of mine was dead and has now returned to life. He was lost, but now he is found.\' So the party began."</span>'
