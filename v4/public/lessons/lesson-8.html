								This lesson challenges students to think about how their social media habits align with their identity as followers of Jesus. By looking at Jesus' words in the Sermon on the Mount, students will explore what it means to be the light of the world and how they can engage with social media in a way that reflects their faith. The lesson also introduces helpful apps and resources that can strengthen their personal study of Scripture.

								<p><strong class="text-yellow-200">Say</strong></p>
								<p>Learning to recognize and listen to God's voice is one of the most important parts of following Jesus. But as you may have noticed, this does not happen instantly. It takes time, practice, and a willingness to tune out distractions.</p>
								<p><strong>Icebreaker Questions</strong></p>
								<p><strong class="text-yellow-200">Ask</strong></p>
								<p>Why do you think learning to hear from God can be so difficult?</p>
								<p class="text-white/60 italic">Answers may include: not knowing what to listen for, distractions, fear of what God might say, etc.</p>
								<p><strong class="text-yellow-200">Ask</strong></p>
								<p>What are the loudest voices in your life, and how do they influence you?</p>
								<p class="text-white/60 italic">Answers may include: social media influencers, family, friends, music and media, etc.</p>
								<p><strong class="text-yellow-200">Say</strong></p>
								<p>There are more voices competing for our attention than we probably realize. But the loudest voice shaping your generation today is social media. Even if you don't use it much, it still impacts the world around you, including everything from trends and memes to the way people interact with each other.</p>
								<p><strong class="text-yellow-200">Say</strong></p>
								<p>Since social media is not going anywhere, how should we engage with it as followers of Jesus? We know it has negative impacts. It can create pressure to compare, lead to temptation, and even become addictive. But it also has positive impacts. It connects people, spreads messages, and can be a tool for sharing the gospel.</p>
								<p><strong class="text-yellow-200">Say</strong></p>
								<p>So, today, we are going to discuss the wisdom God gives us to use social media in a way that shines the light of the gospel without distracting us from our relationships with Jesus.</p>

								<p>Jesus spent much of his time teaching people about a new way of life—one that looks different from the rest of the world. The verses we are reading today come from his most famous teaching: the Sermon on the Mount. It took place on a hillside where hundreds of people gathered to gain wisdom from Jesus.</p>
								<p><strong class="text-yellow-200">Say</strong></p>
								<p>Before we read, take a moment to close your eyes. Take a deep breath. Imagine sitting among the huddled crowds. Jesus' words were not just for his audience on that ancient hillside. They have wisdom for us today, too.</p>
