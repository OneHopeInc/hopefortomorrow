							<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Lesson Summary</h3>
							<p class="text-lg text-white/90 leading-relaxed">
								This lesson invites students to recognize and reflect on how God purposefully created them—including their gender—to uniquely reflect his goodness in the world. Students will explore how God's intentional design connects to the plans he has for them (Psalm 139), and they will consider the root cause of confusion around identity (Ephesians 4). The Practicing Life with Jesus section builds on the practice of personal Scripture reading by introducing the Apply step of the Observe-Interpret-Apply framework.

						</div>

						<div class="mb-6">
							<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Main Point</h3>
							<p class="text-lg text-white font-regular leading-relaxed">
								God created you on purpose, and your gender is an intentional part of God's design and plan for you.

								<p>Body image and gender are very sensitive topics for people who struggle with them. Lead with gentleness and compassion.</p>
								<p>Ensure the exploration of Ephesians 4 is not presented as a personal attack on students questioning their gender but instead offers hope and security that can only be found in their God-given identity.</p>

								<p>This game is called Mirror, Mirror. To begin, break the students into groups of four to six. Explain that there will be two one-minute rounds:</p>
								<p><strong>Round One:</strong> One student in each group will be the "Mover" while the rest are "Mirrors." The Mover will perform simple actions (e.g. waving, making silly faces, striking poses, etc.) while the Mirrors must imitate the Mover as closely as possible in real-time. Encourage the Movers to make the game as challenging as possible.</p>
								<p><strong>Round Two:</strong> A second person from each group will become a Mover. The two Movers will perform their own actions, while the Mirrors must do their best to copy both Movers at the same time. If there is time, repeat Round Two with new Movers.</p>
								<p class="text-white/60 italic">Once both rounds have been completed, gather the students back together.</p>

								<p><strong class="text-yellow-200">Say</strong></p>
								<p>Copying someone else's behaviors can be difficult. And as you probably noticed in our game, copying more than one person is pretty much impossible. This may explain why so many of us go through life feeling like bad imposters. We can feel this way when we try and fail to copy too many different influences. We are not designed to live like this.</p>
								<p><strong class="text-yellow-200">Say</strong></p>
								<p>Instead of hiding behind unconvincing performances of what we think our friends or families want or what society might accept, we can confidently embrace our God-given identity. This is what we are reflecting on today. But before we look at who God says we are in his Word, let's start with a question.</p>
								<p><strong>Icebreaker Question</strong></p>
								<p><strong class="text-yellow-200">Ask</strong></p>
								<p>Why do you think we put so much effort into mirroring the identities of others in the first place?</p>
								<p class="text-white/60 italic">Call on a few volunteers to share.</p>
								<p><strong class="text-yellow-200">Say</strong></p>
								<p>Online and around us, we are constantly flooded with images that remind us who we are not and who we should be—according to the world.</p>
								<p><strong class="text-yellow-200">Say</strong></p>
								<p>But we do not have to mirror the images the world tries to force on us. In fact, God created us to be physical representatives of him—to mirror his beautiful, glorious image. And he created each one of us on purpose to reflect him in our own unique ways.</p>

								When we struggle with identity, the world often offers a quick fix. It promises that by altering our appearance, our personality, or even our gender, we can finally "find ourselves." But this is a false hope that only leads to disappointment. True peace can only come from embracing who God made us to be.

									Take a moment to acknowledge how the language in the passage may be difficult for students to hear when reflecting on their struggles. Emphasize how sin causes all of us to question our identity in some way. But by living a life of daily surrender to Jesus, we can find security in who he says we are, and we can trust that God uses even our struggles to make us more like Jesus.
