							<p class="text-lg text-white/90 leading-relaxed">
								A disciple lives by faith in what Jesus accomplished on the cross, not by their own efforts. Students will explore how Jesus freed us from the weight of sin and gave us new life through his sacrifice. Using Romans 8:3 and Hebrews 12:1-3, they will reflect on their personal "weights" and how to let go of them to run their race with endurance. The practice of prayer journaling will encourage students to trust God with their future.

								<p>According to recent research, 91% of teens in the Philippines reported feeling overwhelmed by pressures at school, and 42% reported experiencing anxiety in the past three months. Spend time praying that the content of today's conversation will speak to your students' heartfelt needs.</p>
								<p>Be aware of your students. Find ways to engage their different learning styles throughout the lesson. Knowing each student's unique needs will help them feel safe and seen and make the lesson more personally meaningful.</p>

								<p class="text-white/60 italic">For this game, every student needs three pieces of paper and a pen. Have students form groups of 4–6. Each group needs a basket or bowl. Consider offering a simple prize like a piece of candy to each group's winner.</p>
								<p><strong class="text-yellow-200">Say</strong></p>
								<p>We are starting class today with some competition. Show of hands: Who here is competitive? We are going to play a game called Casting Your Cares. It is a race of sorts.</p>
								<p><strong class="text-yellow-200">Say</strong></p>
								<p>Everyone take out three pieces of paper. I will ask you three questions, and you will write one answer on each piece of paper. Do not write your name on the papers. Then, fold each paper into tiny squares, and we are going to have a race.</p>
								<p class="text-white/60 italic">Ask the following questions and give students a few minutes to answer them:</p>
								<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
									<li>What is one thing in your life that stresses you out?</li>
									<li>How do you cope when you are feeling overwhelmed?</li>
									<li>What is something you fear about the future?</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong class="text-yellow-200">Say</strong></p>
								<p>Now, with your papers folded, you will race the people in your group to throw all three papers into your basket. The first one to get all his or her papers into the basket wins. Set your baskets three to four steps away from your group. Ready? Set. Go!</p>
								<p class="text-white/60 italic">At the end, congratulate the winners and have students return to their desks. Gather all the papers from the baskets.</p>

								<p>These burdens can take control of our lives if we let them. But thankfully, Jesus made a way for us to live in freedom.</p>

									Jesus is both fully God and fully human. As a human, Jesus ran the race of life without sin. Then, he died in our place, taking the weight of our sins to the cross so we do not have to bear them. But he did not stay dead. When Jesus rose from the grave, he broke the power of death, so it is no longer our finish line. Now, when we live by trusting in Jesus, we are free from the control of sin and the fear of death.

								<p>When running a race, sometimes it seems easier to run it alone than with someone else. That is because it can be tough to trust others, especially when we are unsure if they will come through for us. But when we run with Jesus, we can always be sure he will come through, even though his timing may look different from ours. One way we can practice living by faith is through prayer journaling.</p>
								<p><strong class="text-yellow-200">Say</strong></p>
								<p>Here is how it works: You write down what you are praying for and the date you prayed it. Later, when God answers, you write down how and when. Sometimes, his answers come quickly—like giving you peace during a big test. Other times, the answer takes longer, and we must keep trusting him. Prayer journaling helps us see God's faithfulness over time.</p>
								<p class="text-white/60 italic">Optional: Share with your students an example of a prayer request you had and how God answered it. Choose an example that highlights how God's answers are sometimes unexpected and take time to unfold.</p>
