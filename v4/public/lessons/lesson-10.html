							<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Lesson Summary</h3>
							<p class="text-lg text-white/90 leading-relaxed">
								This lesson invites students to reflect on their vocation, exploring how they can live out their calling in their daily lives and future careers. They will consider their calling to "show others the goodness of God" (1 Peter 2:9-12), connecting their various roles and work to seeking the Kingdom of God (Matthew 6:33). Students will discover that God's plans for their lives start now and that every part of their lives—at school, home or work—becomes meaningful within God's Kingdom.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="mb-6">
							<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Main Point</h3>
							<p class="text-lg text-white font-regular leading-relaxed">
								You are called, in your daily lives and future careers, to participate in God's Kingdom work on earth.

							<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Lesson Objectives</h3>
							<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg text-white/90 leading-relaxed ml-4">
								<li>Students will discuss what it means to seek God's Kingdom in their daily lives and future careers.</li>
								<li>Students will understand that they are called to participate in God's redemptive work.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Teaching Tips</h3>
							<div class="space-y-3 text-lg text-white/90 leading-relaxed">
								<p>Challenge misconceptions about calling. Some students may believe that only "spiritual" jobs (like being a pastor or missionary) count as serving God. Others might think God's purpose for them is something that will happen in the future. This lesson helps them see that every job, relationship, and situation can be used to bring God's Kingdom into the world.</p>

								<p>Some of your additions to our story were subtle; others were major plot twists, but they all played an important part in where and how the story ended.</p>
								<p><strong class="text-yellow-200">Say</strong></p>
								<p>When you step back and think about the story of the world, from when God first created it to this very moment, how do you see yourself? Do you live like the main character? Or do you find it difficult to see how anyone—especially you—could ever make a difference in such a grand story? Either way, you would be wrong.</p>
								<p><strong class="text-yellow-200">Say</strong></p>
								<p>Every moment of your life plays a part in the story of how God is redeeming the world. The choices you make, the skills you develop, and even the career you pursue are all opportunities for God to work in and through you. He uses our lives to restore the brokenness caused by sin.</p>

								<p><strong>Icebreaker Question:</strong></p>
								<p><strong class="text-yellow-200">Ask</strong></p>
								<p>What do you think it typically looks like for someone to contribute to God's story? How have you seen other believers make a meaningful impact in the world?</p>
								<p class="text-white/60 italic">If they need help, share these examples:</p>
								<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4 text-white/90">
									<li>an entrepreneur who builds a business that benefits her community</li>

									<li>a student who shares the Gospel with her friends at school</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong class="text-yellow-200">Say</strong></p>
								<p>Some people assume that only pastors and missionaries are doing God's work, or that God's plan for them is in the future—when they are older. But that is not true. Every single day of your life is part of God's Kingdom work. Whether you're at school, home, work, or planning for the future, you have a role to play.</p>
