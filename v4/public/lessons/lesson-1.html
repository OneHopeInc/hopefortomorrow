								This lesson introduces students to the concept of discipleship by exploring the story of Simon Peter's call to follow Jesus. Through a guided discussion, students will reflect on what it means to follow Jesus and consider how this might look in their own lives. The lesson highlights that discipleship is not about having everything figured out but about growing in a relationship with God through knowing Jesus.

								<p>Strive to be open and approachable. Remember that everyone's journey is unique, and it is okay if students are not ready to open up immediately. Be ready to embrace some awkward silence. Today is all about creating a space where they feel comfortable asking questions and exploring what following Jesus could mean for them.</p>
								<p>Relax and keep the content engaging and interactive. Avoid lecturing the students. Pause for a moment between portions of the introduction. Add playfulness to the language and be expressive in your speech.</p>

								Raise your hand if "discipleship" is a new word for you. (Pause for a moment and raise your hand.) It comes from the word "disciple," which is another word for "student." The first followers of Jesus were called disciples. Discipleship is the lifelong journey of following Jesus in order to learn from and become like him.
							</p>
							<p class="text-lg text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-3">
								When Jesus calls us to be his disciples, he calls us to leave behind what we think we know and follow him instead. At the heart of this call is an invitation into a relationship with God. God sent his Son Jesus into the world so that we could know him. Following Jesus is about coming to know the God who already knows you perfectly and finding your true life and purpose in that relationship.

								Teacher, share a brief story with your students about your own experience growing in a relationship with Jesus. This is an opportunity for you to be authentic and vulnerable—everything you want to encourage your students to be. If you need help, consider the following questions:

								<p class="text-lg text-white/90 leading-relaxed">
									One simple way to define sin is that it is anything we think, say, or do that goes against God. Being sinful is about more than bad behaviors. It is about the tendency of our hearts to turn away from the God who loves us and put our trust in things that cannot truly satisfy or fill our hearts. If discipleship is about growing in our relationship with God by following Jesus, then sin is what damages that relationship by leading us away from God.
								</p>
								<p class="text-lg text-white/90 leading-relaxed mt-4">
									When Peter said he was a sinful man and told Jesus to leave him, he was recognizing the spiritual distance between himself and God. But what Peter did not yet realize is that God had sought him out. God was standing right in front of him! That realization would come as he got to know Jesus more.

									Thank you all for your thoughtful responses. As we have been discussing this passage, something may have occurred to you: Peter <em>literally</em> followed Jesus. He walked and talked with Jesus face-to-face.
								</p>
								<p class="text-lg text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-3">
									Clearly, Jesus is not standing in front of us in the same way today. So, what does it mean to follow or have a relationship with Jesus today?
								</p>
								<p class="text-lg text-white/60 italic mb-3">(Provide a few moments for students to think.)</p>
								<p class="text-lg text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-3">
									Jesus is no longer physically present the way he was to Peter, but he is actually with us in a much closer way. Jesus sends his Holy Spirit to live in his followers. The Holy Spirit is God who comes to make his home in us. The Holy Spirit transforms our hearts and draws us to Jesus, giving us the faith that leads to salvation.
								</p>
								<p class="text-lg text-white/90 leading-relaxed">
									Through the Holy Spirit, Jesus is always present to his followers, guiding, teaching, and comforting us. This is good news because the journey of discipleship is not one we can accomplish on our own. Remember, it is about growing in our relationship with God. And the way any relationship grows is through communication.
