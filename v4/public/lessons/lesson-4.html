							<p class="text-lg text-white/90 leading-relaxed">
								This lesson concludes Unit One's invitation to discipleship by highlighting that following Jesus is about being with him more than doing things for him. Students will explore the story of Mary and Martha, identify their own distractions, and practice praying Scripture so they can sit with Jesus and listen for the Holy Spirit's voice.

						</div>

						<div class="mb-6">
							<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Main Point</h3>
							<p class="text-lg text-white font-regular leading-relaxed">
								Discipleship is not about outward efforts or performance but about being with Jesus and listening to him.

								<p>Now, let us talk about what happened. You all probably knew from the start how this would play out. [Insert the volunteer's name] was bound to drop the ball because they were doing too much. They were performing a balancing act.</p>
								<p>Part of maturing is learning to find balance in our lives so we do not drop the things that are most important. But life has a way of getting busy, and finding balance is easier said than done.</p>

								<p><strong class="text-yellow-200">Ask</strong></p>

Through the Spirit, Jesus makes his home in our hearts so we can always be in his presence. Before Jesus was crucified, he explained that it was good for him to leave because he would send the Holy Spirit to his disciples. Let us read what he said.

								<p>For the past few weeks, we have been practicing prayer as a key way of growing in our relationship with Jesus. Sometimes it is hard to recognize his voice with all the competing noise. One practice that can help us hear him better is praying Scripture.</p>
								<p class="text-white/60 italic">The Bible is not just God's Word to us—it is also something we can speak back to God. When we pray Scripture, it sinks deep, shaping our hearts and minds and training us to recognize the Holy Spirit's voice.
